I commpleted The Base. I did not have very much trouble making it because the instructions were relativley simple and clear. I did however, struggle a little when I needed to use the linear pattern function, but I figured it out after a little bit of thinking and it was all good.

I completed The Mount. I did not have any problems when completing this assignment due to the instructions being clear.  I liked how in the instruction video he showed multiple different ways you could make the part and explained the benefits and drawbacks of each method.

I completed the Fork. I had fun making this part because I did not struggle but the part was complex and took lots of different features to complete.

I completed the Tire. This assignment did not take very long because the video was short and even though the part might look complex it is just a simple sketch that turned into a cool shape when I revolved it.

For this assignment I had to create the Wheel for the Caster.

I completed the Wheel. I liked making this part even though I did not think it was very difficult because I thought that the process of making it was very appealing like after I revolved the sketch and put in all the fillets.

I completed the Axle, Collar and Bearings. I thought this was an interesting project because it involed making multiple parts and conecting them. Now that I am done with all the parts I am exited to start assembiling them to make the caster.

## Sub Assembly

For this assignment I had to make a sub assembly for the caster.

![SubAssembly](Images/SubAssembly.png)

I completed the sub assembly for the caster. This was an interesting assignment because it involved building things in an assembly which I had not done before. It wasn't too hard to make but I did struggle a little more than I usually do because it was a new type of design.

##  Final Assembly

For this assignment I finished making the caster in the final assembly.
