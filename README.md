I commpleted The Base. I did not have very much trouble making it because the instructions were relativley simple and clear. I did however, struggle a little when I needed to use the linear pattern function, but I figured it out after a little bit of thinking and it was all good.

I completed The Mount. I did not have any problems when completing this assignment due to the instructions being clear.  I liked how in the instruction video he showed multiple different ways you could make the part and explained the benefits and drawbacks of each method.

I completed the Fork. I had fun making this part because I did not struggle but the part was complex and took lots of different features to complete.

I completed the Tire. This assignment did not take very long because the video was short and even though the part might look complex it is just a simple sketch that turned into a cool shape when I revolved it.

I completed the Wheel. I liked making this part even though I did not think it was very difficult because I thought that the process of making it was very appealing like after I revolved the sketch and put in all the fillets.
