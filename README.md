I commpleated The Base. I did not have very much trobble making it because the instroctions were relitivley simple and clear. I did however, struggle a little when I needed to use the linear pettern function, but I figered it out after a little bit of thinking and it was all good.

I compleated The Mount. I did not have any problemes when completing this assignment due to the instructions being clear.  I liked how in the instruction video he showed multiple different ways you culd make the part and explained the benefites and drawbacks of each methode.
